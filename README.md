# SuperRickRoll
The Ultimate Windows RickRoll script.

Rickroll anyone with an invisible rickroll that can't be closed >:)

# Requirements

Note that this Rick Roll only works on Windows, as it uses VBScript to run the song hidden

Other than that, the only requirement is Python 3.10!

# Usage

Download main.py and run it. That's it!

To stop the song, open Task Manager and look for a task called "Microsoft Windows Based Script Host"

End the task and the song is over.

The files are downloaded to %USERPROFILE%\Windows , you can delete them from there
